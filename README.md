# todor-reloaded
A general purpose Discord bot that I decided to make for the server that I share with my friends. Use at your own discretion. There are bugs, and it is kinda janky, but whatever. I am working on making it better, but don't expect it to compete with some of the bigger bots out there, nor is it intended to. I made this for fun, because I wanted to. Feeback is much appreciated.
